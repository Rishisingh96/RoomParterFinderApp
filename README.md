Room Partner Finder – Smart & Secure Living Companion

🧠 Problem Statement: Why This Project?
With growing urban migration due to education and employment, young individuals often relocate to new cities. In this transition, finding a reliable and compatible roommate becomes a critical challenge. Most people face the following pain points:
	• 🔍 Lack of trusted platforms to find roommates who share similar lifestyles.
	• 🧩 No detailed filtering for personal preferences (e.g., food habits, religion, occupation, etc.).
	• 📉 Inadequate listing of rooms or hostels, especially for first-time movers.
	• 🚫 Security and privacy risks while connecting with strangers on public platforms.
	• 🔕 Lack of real-time updates, making users miss out on potential matches.
This inspired the idea to develop a smart roommate-finding system that not only solves these problems but also ensures a secure, verified, and scalable solution tailored for students and working professionals.

🎯 Objective of the Project
The Room Partner Finder web app is designed to:
	• ✅ Enable intelligent roommate matching based on detailed filters.
	• ✅ Allow users to explore verified nearby rooms or hostels with rich media and location data.
	• ✅ Provide a secure platform for communication with strict privacy controls.
	• ✅ Implement a personalized notification system for updates and new matches.
	• ✅ Lay the foundation for AI integration and future scalability into mobile apps.

💡 Key Modules & Features Explained
🔍 1. Smart Room Partner Filter System
This is the heart of the application. Users can find ideal roommates by selecting multiple filters including:

Food Preference	Veg / Non-Veg compatibility
Occupation	Understand routine (Student / Working / Other)

Religion (Optional)	Filter based on cultural or religious background
🔍 Backed by highly optimized SQL JOINs and WHERE clauses for multi-dimensional search.
